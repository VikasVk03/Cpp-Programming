// arrfun2.cpp  -- functions with an array argument

/*

*****************
- If you pass an ordinary variable the function, the function works with copy. But if you pass an array, the function works with the original.

- The design decision to use array address as arguments saves the time and memory needed to copy an entire
array. the overhead for using copies can be prohibitive if you're working with large arrays. with copies,
not only does a program need more computer memory, but it has to spend time copying large blocks of data.

- working with the original data raises the possibility of inadvertent data corruption.
